### 🧠 Why Is It Called GSManager?

- **GSManager** is the **Python-based backend** of ManuAdminMod.
- It's the engine that connects the **game logs** to admin scripts.
- It reads the `games_mp.log` and `console_mp.log` files generated by the game server to **react to events** like player joins, kills, or chat messages.

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

1. **CoD4 server** writes game events to `.log` files.
2. **ManuAdminMod** monitors these logs in real-time.
3. It processes events and triggers actions (kick, announce, stats update).
4. Admins interact through in-game chat or a remote interface (some versions offer web UIs).

---

### 🖥️ Requirements

- A **dedicated or VPS server** hosting your CoD4 server.
- Python installed (for GSManager).
- Correct configuration of:
  - `games_mp.log` in the CoD4 config
  - ManuAdminMod/GSManager settings and rules
  - Permissions system

---

### 🔒 Popular Among:

- Promod servers
- Public TDM/SD servers
- Competitive community servers
- Admins who want automation without complex modding

### 🗂️ 2. **Folder Structure Example**

Place these somewhere like:
```
C:\GSManager\
    ├── config\
    ├── logs\
    ├── plugins\
    ├── translations\
    ├── main.py
    └── server.log
```

---

### ⚙️ 3. **Modify Your CoD4 Server Config**

In your `server.cfg` or `mod.cfg`, ensure:

```cfg
set g_logSync "2"
set g_log "games_mp.log"
set sv_logDamage "1"
set sv_voice "0"
set sv_allowDownload "1"
```

Also helpful:
```cfg
set sv_maxPing "300"
set sv_timeout "60"
```

📁 **Log file location:**  
CoD4 will output `games_mp.log` in the `main` folder or profile folder depending on setup.

---

### 🧠 4. **Configure GSManager**

In `GSManager/config/servers.cfg`:

```ini
[myserver]
game = cod4
logfile = C:/path/to/your/games_mp.log
ip = 127.0.0.1
port = 28960
rconpassword = your_rcon_password
```

In `GSManager/config/gsmanager.cfg`:

```ini
language = en
database = sqlite
admin_file = admins.ini
```

In `admins.ini`:

```ini
[AdminName]
password = optional
level = 100
groups = superadmin
```

> 🔐 Admin levels go from 0 (lowest) to 100 (highest).

---

### 🚀 5. **Run GSManager**

Open a terminal / command prompt and run:

```bash
python main.py
```

If you're using a virtualenv or specific Python version, adjust accordingly.

---

### 🎮 6. **In-Game Commands**

Now in your server, type in chat:

```
!help
!nextmap
!kick playername
!warn playername camping
```

As an admin, you can use:

```
!map mp_crossfire
!ban playername
```

---

### 🛠️ 7. **Optional Features**

- **Map voting plugin**
- **Auto team balancer**
- **Anti-camp detection**
- **Welcome messages**

Just enable/disable plugins in `plugins/` and configure their `.ini` files.

---

### ❓ Common Issues

- `games_mp.log` not updating? Make sure `g_logSync` is set to `2`.
- GSManager not reacting? Check paths, permissions, and ensure Python can read the log file.
- Commands not working? Check your admin level in `admins.ini`.
